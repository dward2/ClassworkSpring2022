# ClassworkSpring2022

This is my repository for BME 547 classwork.<br>
In this repository, I will be developing a health database.

## Health Database
### Specifications
Here are the specifications for my database
* Patient Name
* Patient ID
* Patient Age
* List of tests and their results

### Patient record types
Three different versions of how the patient data is stored has
been created in this repository.  
* First, the patient data was
stored in a list.  This version can be found on the `database2`
branch.
* Second, the patient data was stored in a dictionary.  This
version can be found on the `dictionaries` branch.
* Third, the patient data was stored in a class.  This version
can be found on the `classes` branch, as well as the `main` branch.
